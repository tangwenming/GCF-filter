# GCF-filter

Gaussian Curvature Filter on 3D Meshes

The specific usage is:
1. Put the mesh to be optimized in the same root directory as GCF.exe (supported mesh formats: obj, off, stl, wrl, ply).
2. Execute commands such as: GCF.exe input_mesh.obj 40 (input_mesh.obj is the mesh to be optimized, and 40 is the number of iterations).
3. The output is GCF_input_mesh_40.off (the optimized mesh output is in the same root directory)

The GPU version and source code will be released after the paper is published.
